# birds_classification_with_ViT

This project is part of a data challenge that was introduced in the Image Recognition & Computer Vision (RecVis) MVA class. 
We explore the use of Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification on a dataset of bird images. The Birds dataset is composed of 1082 training images, 103 validation and 517 test images. There are 20 classes of birds.

I fine-tuned a pretrained ViT model on our augmented dataset using a HuggingFace hosted ViT model that was pretrained on the large ImageNet-21k (14 million images, 21,843 classes). I also attempted to visualize and interpret self-attention on the last layer of the ViT model. Please refer to the assignment report for more details.
